# 🔍 RAG_APP — Retrieval-Augmented Generation Web App

**RAG_APP** is a Streamlit-powered application that allows users to upload PDF documents, embed their content into a vector database using **OpenAI embeddings**, and perform semantic search with natural language queries. The answers are generated contextually using **LangChain** and **GPT models**.

This project demonstrates a complete **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** pipeline using modern tools like **Pinecone**, **OpenAI**, and **LangChain**.

## 🧪 Example Workflow

1. **Upload a PDF**  
   Choose any document with readable text.

2. **Indexing**  
   The file gets split into chunks, embedded using OpenAI, and stored in Pinecone.

3. **Ask a Question**  
   Type a question like:  
   `"What is the no claim discount (NCD) offered in this policy?"`

4. **Get Answer**  
   The app finds relevant document chunks and asks GPT to summarize/answer.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| App crashes on PDF upload | Ensure the PDF is not encrypted or image-based only |
| `KeyError: _API_KEY` | Check if `.env` is set up and variables are named correctly |
